        1. Difference between map, filter,foreach and find?
      </h2>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">MAP():</h4>
      <p>
        map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a
        new array with the updated elements.
      </p>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">.filter():</h4>
      <p>
        filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain
        criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy
        for the criteria.
      </p>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">forEach():</h4>
      <p>
        forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array
        but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
      </p>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">find():</h4>
      <p>
        Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they
        differ in one small detail â€” this function returns only one match in an
        array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return
        the first that has matched.

        2. Difference between localstorage vs sessionstorage and cookies
      </h2>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">localstorage</h4>
      <p>
        localStorage is a way to store data on the client's computer. It allows
        the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with
        no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript,
        and HTML5
      </p>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">sessionstorage</h4>
      <p>
        stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until
        the browser (or tab) is closed
      </p>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-xs">Cookie</h4>
      <p>
        Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR
        requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration
        duration can be set from either server-side or client-side . Cookies are
        primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side),
        localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.

        3. What is an event loop in JavaScript ?
      </h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript event loop is the mechanism that enables asynchronous
        programming in JavaScript. It is responsible for managing the order in
        which the code is executed in response to events, such as user actions,
        server responses, and timers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event loop has two main components: the call stack and the event
        queue. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the
        function calls in the current execution context. The event queue is a
        data structure that holds the events waiting to be processed.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">1. quizTimer():</h2>
      <p>
        quizTimer accept true from "index.js" , and 'index.js' send "true" and

        chooseQuiz accept two parameter form displayQuizOptions(), one parameter
        of "index number or serial number" another of "option". when user click
        a "option" as a question answer. which option click the user . this
        track the chooseQuiz. That mean, which option click user this tracking
        chooseQuiz() function.
